Nordff Wordpress Theme

Wordpress theme developed for The Nord Family Foundation

Built using HTMl, CSS, PHP, Javascript / JQuery, and Bootstrap.

Highlights include category archives, featured posts, and an elegant reader experience.

Custom post types through the Adavanced Custom Fields plugin create intuitive content types for users. Among these are Articles, Podcasts and Grants*.

Extensive use is made of the Featured Image field, as well as the native WYSIWIG editor in Wordpress. Navigation of posts is primarily handled by categories. The theme optimizes content for Feed Readers using RSS. 

Responsive design features prominently in the design of the theme using the Bootstrap grid system to manage responsiveness gracefully across a wide array of screen sizes.

*Grants have been disabled currently in accordance with concerns over the general utility of such a function for program officers and office staff. The Foundation uses a well maintained and fairly complex grants databasing system already, and while cool, the post type was in some ways superfluous.
